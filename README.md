# SchlierenImaging

**Laboratory for Medical Imaging and Experimental Radiology at FHSF**

Welcome to the Laboratory for Medical Imaging and Experimental Radiology at FHSWF! Our organization is dedicated to advancing the field of medical imaging through innovative research and experimentation.

**Overview**

The repository contains code and supplementary material for an experimental Schlieren imaging setup that visualizes High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in real-time enabling the user to display, observe and analyze the sound field.
In addition, the repository includes code for image analysis, specifically for analyzing the shift of the focal point of the HIFU beam if an acoustic lens is used in the setup. The code is written in Python and MATLAB and is designed to be easily customizable and adaptable to different experimental setups.

**Supplementary Material**

The repository also includes supplementary material such as construction files for 3D-printed mounts and housings used in the setup. These files are intended to be used as a reference for constructing the experimental setup and can be modified as needed.

**Getting Started**

To get started, you will need a Raspberry Pi with its camera module and a Schlieren imaging setup. Once you have obtained the necessary equipment, you can clone the repository and use the provided code to acquire and analyze images of the HIFU beam in real-time.

**Contributions**

Contributions to the repository are welcome and encouraged. If you have suggestions for improving the code or the experimental setup, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

**License**

This repository is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to use our code and data for your own research projects, but please give credit to our organization if you do. Please see the LICENSE file for more information.

Thank you for your interest in the Laboratory for Medical Imaging and Experimental Radiology at FHSF! We look forward to working with you.
